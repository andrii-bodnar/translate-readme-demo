# translate-readme-demo

This is a demo project for the [crowdin/translate-readme](https://github.com/crowdin/translate-readme) GH Action. It shows how to use the action to translate your README file into multiple languages.

See the `.github/workflows/translate-readme.yml` file to see how the action is configured.

You can also check [the PR](https://github.com/andrii-bodnar/translate-readme-demo/pull/1) with the translation of this README file into multiple languages. This PR also includes the Language Switcher automatically created by the action.

Also, visit the [readme-translate-test](https://crowdin.com/project/readme-translate-test) project in Crowdin to see how the translations are managed.
